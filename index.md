# Fedora Silverblue

Designed from the core to be stable, easy to use, and modern—oh, and excellent for developers. Silverblue uses an “immutable” design—that is, the core of every install of the same version is identical, and it never changes as your computer is used. That makes Silverblue more stable than other OSes, but also excellent for developers using containers.

## Get Involved

Fedora Silverblue is an open community seeking contributors from everywhere, and of every type. In addition to many core projects needing code in various languages, we also need:

* help writing documentation
* expert users to answer questions from less experienced users
* testers who can try out new releases and features

If you are a programmer, please check out [rpm-ostree](https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree) and [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org) and the many related projects on GitHub for places to contribute. We accept pull requests and do not require a CLA.

If you are a designer, a storyteller who is interested in tech, a technical writer, or otherwise interested in contributing to the [website]({{site.sourceurl}}) or [documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/), please check out the GitHub repositories for the website and documentation. If you're not comfortable with GitHub, you can always create a topic in the community forums.

If you find a problem or want to suggest a feature, you can use the [issue tracker]({{site.issuesurl}}).

### Meet the Team

We've canceled IRC meetings in favor of discussiong things timezone-independently on the [forums](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/silverblue).

Outside of the forums, you can always come by and chat about Silverblue in the `#silverblue` IRC channel on `Libera.Chat` or in `[#silverblue:fedoraproject.org](https://matrix.to/#/#silverblue:fedoraproject.org)` on Matrix.

You can best discuss Silverblue in our [community](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/silverblue).

Silverblue is a work in progress. Join now and help us shape its future!

## Solid Foundations

Silverblue is built on a solid model that separates the immutable base OS from the applications and development environments.

Applications are distributed on the state of the art system called [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org).

Development environments are managed inside containers, using [Toolbx](https://containertoolbx.org). 

## Installation & Use

To manage the OS itself, Silverblue relies on `rpm-ostree`. [See more information on how to use it](rpmostree).
