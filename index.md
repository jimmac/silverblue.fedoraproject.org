# Fedora Silverblue
### The future of computing, today.

Designed from the core to be stable, easy to use, and modern—oh, and excellent for developers.

## Immutable. Inimitable.

Silverblue uses an “immutable” design—that is, the core of every install of the same version is identical, and it never changes as your computer is used. That makes Silverblue more stable than other OSes, but also excellent for developers using containers.

## Updated fast. Fast to update.

There’s a new major version twice a year with refinements to the core apps, desktop experience, and underlying technologies. Bug fixes and improvements are released nearly every day. And installing updates is fast—just continue using your computer, and they’re applied the next time you restart.

## Reliable with rollbacks.

Even in the face of catastrophic failure, Silverblue’s design is superior. If an OS update doesn’t complete for some unforseen reason, it just won’t be applied. And if too much tinkering leads to something going wrong, simply roll back to the previous version and you’re back up and running.
